# Advent of code 2018 Solutions

These are my solutions to the (2018 advent of code)[https://www.adventofcode.com/2018]. They're written in Haskell. Some of them I stopped as soon as I got the right answer. Some of them I tidied up a bit afterwards.

On day 8, I didn't start at 5am, but I did time myself. I solved part A after 14:17 from start, and part B after 18:09 from start. If I had started at 5am, I would not have placed in the top 100. Place #100 solved both parts in 12:10. I think I could have placed if I hadn't missed a call to P.skipSpace in my parser. 

On day 9, I also didn't start at 5am, but I timed myself again. I solved both parts in 28:16 (the first part was solved just a few seconds before that - once I'd solved the first part in the way I did, the second part was solved quickly enough). This time would have placed me at #94.
